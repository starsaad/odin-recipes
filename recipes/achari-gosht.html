    <h2># Description:</h2>
    
    <p>Achari Gosht is a flavorful and aromatic Indian-Pakistani meat dish known for its bold, tangy taste inspired by traditional pickling spices. 
        <br>Made with tender pieces of mutton or beef, it is simmered in a rich, spicy gravy that features a unique blend of ingredients like fennel seeds, 
        <br>mustard seeds, nigella seeds (kalonji), fenugreek, and dried red chiliesâ€”common in South Asian pickles (achar). Yogurt adds creaminess and balances 
        <br>the heat, while a splash of vinegar or lemon juice enhances its signature tang. Often served with naan or steamed rice, Achari Gosht offers a punchy, 
        <br>comforting experience that combines the zest of pickles with the heartiness of slow-cooked meat.
