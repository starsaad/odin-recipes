    <h2># Description</h2>

    <p>Qeema (also spelled keema) is a classic South Asian dish made from minced meat, typically beef, mutton, or chicken, cooked with a flavorful blend of spices. It's a hearty and versatile dish, 
        <br>often prepared with onions, tomatoes, green chilies, garlic, and ginger, then spiced with ingredients like cumin, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric. Qeema can be dry or slightly saucy, 
        <br>and it may include peas or potatoes for added texture and flavor. Served with roti, paratha, or rice, qeema is a comforting, everyday meal that's rich in taste and easy to adapt to personal preferences.
